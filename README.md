## How does it works 🐍


Python application that allows you to recognize foods, create recipes and create a personalized diet
The app will be able to use your spare food to make a meal, a desert, a snack or even breakfast. This is based on photos taken by the user.

## Artificial Intelligence 🧠

- Its sends the file where it can be compared to all the pictures
- Using the “Detect Program” it will compare it to all the pictures an find the right name
- If the detection goes wrong the user will be able to set the food they are trying to detect manually
- It will then send the result to a program for the app to work
